Q1. Explain how arrays are represented in memory and their advantages.

Sol:
    In Java, arrays are a collection of elements stored in contiguous memory locations. Each element can be
    accessed using an index. The index starts at 0 and goes up to the length of the array minus one.

    Advantages of Arrays:-
    Constant Time Access: Since arrays use contiguous memory locations, accessing any element by its index
    takes O(1) time.
    Predictable Memory Usage: The size of an array is fixed, so memory usage is predictable.

Q2. Analyze the time complexity of each operation (add, search, traverse, delete).

Sol:
    Time Complexity Analysis :-

    Add: O(1) if the array has space, O(n) if resizing is needed.
    Search: O(n) in the worst case, as we might have to check each element.
    Traverse: O(n), as we visit each element.
    Delete: O(n) in the worst case, as we might have to shift elements.

Q3. Discuss the limitations of arrays and when to use them.

Sol:
    Limitations of Arrays :-

    Fixed Size: Arrays can't dynamically resize; a new array must be created if more space is needed.
    Insertion/Deletion Cost: Inserting or deleting elements can be expensive because it might involve
    shifting elements.
